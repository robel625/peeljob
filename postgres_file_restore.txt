    1. Copy the backup file from your Windows file system to the Docker container. To do so, you can use the following command in the Docker container:
            docker cp <file_path_on_windows> <container_name>:<container_directory_path>
     eg: docker cp peel.sql  pgdb_peeljob:/peel.sql


   2. Log in to the Docker container using the following command:
            docker exec -it <container_name> bash
      eg: docker exec -it pgdb_peeljob /bin/bash

   3. Once you are logged in to the Docker container, navigate to the directory where you copied the backup file using the `cd` command.

   4. Use the `pg_restore` command to restore the database from the backup file. You can use the following command:
         pg_restore -U <username> -d <database_name> <backup_file_name>
     eg: pg_restore -U postgres -d postgres peel.sql
